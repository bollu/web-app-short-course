## Shortcomings of literate style

- increasingly long iteration cycles
- lack of incremental builds make experimentation frustrating
- need to exit =build/= folder and come back to it since all inodes are destroyed
- painful to track down errors since the files are generated
- Literate code does not seem to increase code quality. Indeed, docs and code
  sometimes contradict each other making it confusing
- cannot use features like flask's instant reload because it rewrites every single file (and folder structure)
- weird editing errors (=s q p ?= interlocking for example) that won't even exist with something sane
